      <h2>Memory of matcha</h2>
      <p>
        In 1996, Franco-Japanese chef Antoine Hirashi opened a small Saint-Germain-des-Prés atelier, driven by a childhood ritual.
        Raised between Paris and Kyoto, he remembers afternoons when his grandmother paired matcha tea with delicate pastries.
        After mastering French haute-chocolaterie, he realized no chocolate captured that harmony of flavors. Determined to craft it
        himself, he fused refined French techniques with subtle Japanese tea notes, placing matcha and hojicha at the heart of the
        brand.

      <h2>Rare ingredients, responsible sourcing</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
          Kōbōs supply chain centers on exceptional ingredients: premium cacao from South America and West Africa under sustainable
          practices; matcha from Kyoto and Uji with organic certifications; Madagascan vanilla; Japanese yuzu and sakura for special
          editions; and exotic spices such as ginger, saffron, and black sesame. Manuka honey and other rare elements elevate limited
          releases, justifying the brands premium positioning.
        </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        Availability is a constant challenge—scarcity empowers suppliers in pricing negotiations. To honor the ingredients, finished
        chocolates are stored under strict temperature and humidity controls, while seasonal batches are produced in limited volumes
        to maximize freshness.

    <section class="section">
      <div class="meta">Market forces</div>
      <h2>Volatility and competition</h2>
      <p>
        Ingredient price swings driven by climate, geopolitics, and trade policies can pressure margins. While the luxury sector
        remains resilient, dips in local purchasing power may affect European sales, making Asian and Middle Eastern markets key
        growth pillars. Kōbō competes with renowned French maisons such as Pierre Hermé, La Maison du Chocolat, and Patrick Roger, as
        well as Japanese chocolatiers in Paris. Gourmet pastries and macarons represent indirect competition.

      <h2>Packaging and limited editions</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
          To honor exceptional products, Kōbō invests in premium, eco-conscious packaging from specialized partners. European
          anti-waste legislation accelerates the shift to sustainable materials—raising costs but strengthening the brand image.
          Limited editions accompany moments like Lunar New Year, Valentines Day, Easter, and holiday advent calendars. Custom
          finishes and personalization options reflect both Franco-Japanese aesthetics and client-specific needs.

      <h2>Training, culture, and craftsmanship</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
          Rapid international growth created staffing challenges; the brand will not compromise on skill or quality. Kōbōs
          leadership cultivates a participative, exacting, and caring management style rooted in respect for Franco-Japanese
          traditions. Continuous training preserves multi-generational know-how, while financial incentives, tailored career paths,
          and mobility opportunities foster loyalty.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/gallery-atelier.jpg" alt="Artisan training" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Employee wellbeing is central: calming work environments, cultural sharing moments, and creative freedom in bespoke
        projects. The main risk remains the loss of artisanal expertise and the pressure of sustaining the brands image during rapid
        expansion. Intercultural training and weekly exchanges help align teams across markets.
