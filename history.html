          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            Founded recently in 2025 as a small artisanal venture, the company began with a simple vision: to produce premium olive oil that captures the richness and authenticity of Tunisian olives. Inspired by generations of traditional olive cultivation, the company combines ancestral cold-pressing techniques with modern production methods to deliver a product that is both high-quality and sustainable.

From the very beginning, the focus has been on purity, flavor, and wellness, highlighting the natural benefits of olive oil while maintaining the integrity of its heritage. By emphasizing craftsmanship, careful selection of olives, and eco-conscious production, the company has quickly gained attention in both local and international gourmet markets.

Despite operating in a competitive environment, the company positions itself as a premium, authentic, and sustainable brand, offering consumers an experience that reflects both tradition and modern excellence. Its products appeal to discerning buyers who value quality, health, and authenticity in every drop.

          <h3>Market Challenges and Regulatory Environment</h3>
          <p>
          Despite its rapid success, Aurelia Oliva operates in a highly competitive and increasingly regulated sector. Strict food-safety standards and traceability requirements from both the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture and the European Union significantly influence operations. Premium ingredients — especially organic olives — must meet rigorous certification criteria. Although EU trade agreements facilitate the export of Tunisian olive oil, they introduce complex requirements related to origin labeling, pesticide limits, and quality testing. These regulations increase supply-chain costs and push the company toward continuous quality improvement.

          Fluctuating global trade dynamics, unstable olive harvests due to climate change, and currency fluctuations (particularly against the euro) also impact production costs. Meanwhile, international demand for premium olive oil continues to grow, especially in Europe, Asia, and North America, where consumers increasingly value high-end, healthy, and artisanal products.

        2. Upper-middle-class residents of major Tunisian cities

        Professionals and food lovers seeking refined, healthy products that reflect local heritage and modern craftsmanship.

        Drawn to unique aromas, cold-press techniques, and single-origin limited editions.

      <h2>Supply Chain and Raw Materials</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
         Aurelia Oliva’s supply chain emphasizes quality, sustainability, and transparency:

         Chemlali olives sourced from family farms in Sidi Bou Ali and Kairouan

         Chetoui olives from the northwest regions of Béja and Siliana

         All olives harvested by hand and cold-pressed within 6 hours to preserve antioxidants

         Exclusive ingredients for infused oils, such as wild rosemary, Sicilian lemon, chili, basil, and truffle essence

         Packaging materials sourced from eco-responsible suppliers in Tunisia and Italy

         The main challenge remains the irregularity of olive harvests due to drought, climate variability, and limited water resources in Tunisia’s central regions.

         Raw material prices — especially for organic olives and high-quality glass bottles — are also highly volatile, influenced by weather conditions and global demand.

         Although the premium olive oil segment is resilient, reduced purchasing power in Tunisia may affect domestic sales. However, exports to Europe, the Gulf, and Asia continue to grow significantly.

      Aurelia Oliva competes with well-established Tunisian brands such as:

Terra Delyssa

Olivko

Domaine Adonis

Chouchene Olive Oil

International premium olive oil producers from Italy, Spain, and Greece also represent strong competitors in global markets.

However, the increasing global interest in healthy, authentic, and traceable Mediterranean products offers a major opportunity for Aurelia Oliva. Entry barriers in the premium segment — such as quality consistency, branding, artisanal skill, and certifications — remain high, giving the company a competitive advantage.

The brand’s strengths include:

A strong Tunisian heritage

A unique fusion of traditional and modern extraction methods

High-level craftsmanship

A rising global appetite for natural, premium olive oils.

      <div class="split">
        <p>
         Rapid international growth created staffing challenges; the brand will not compromise on skill or quality. Aurelia Oliva’s leadership cultivates a participative, exacting, and caring management style rooted in respect for traditional Tunisian olive-growing heritage. Continuous training preserves multi-generational know-how, while financial incentives, tailored career paths, and mobility opportunities foster employee loyalty.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/gallery-atelier.jpg" alt="Artisan training" />
      </div>
      <p>
       Employee wellbeing is central: calming work environments, cultural sharing moments, and creative freedom in bespoke olive oil projects. The main risk remains the loss of artisanal expertise and the pressure of sustaining the brand’s image during rapid expansion. Intercultural training and weekly exchanges help align teams across different markets.
