          <p>
            A Franco-Japanese chocolate house born in Saint-Germain-des-Prés,
            shaped by childhood rituals, artisan rigor, and an obsession with
            harmonious flavors.

      <h2>Memory of matcha</h2>
      <p>
        In 1996, Franco-Japanese chef Antoine Hirashi opened a small
        Saint-Germain-des-Prés atelier, driven by a childhood ritual. Raised
        between Paris and Kyoto, he remembers afternoons when his grandmother
        paired matcha tea with delicate pastries. After mastering French
        haute-chocolaterie, he realized no chocolate captured that harmony of
        flavors. Determined to craft it himself, he fused refined French
        techniques with subtle Japanese tea notes, placing matcha and hojicha at
        the heart of the brand.

      <h2>Rare ingredients, responsible sourcing</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
          Kōbōs supply chain centers on exceptional ingredients: premium cacao
          from South America and West Africa under sustainable practices; matcha
          from Kyoto and Uji with organic certifications; Madagascan vanilla;
          Japanese yuzu and sakura for special editions; and exotic spices such
          as ginger, saffron, and black sesame. Manuka honey and other rare
          elements elevate limited releases, justifying the brands premium
          positioning.

      <p>
        Availability is a constant challengescarcity empowers suppliers in
        pricing negotiations. To honor the ingredients, finished chocolates are
        stored under strict temperature and humidity controls, while seasonal
        batches are produced in limited volumes to maximize freshness.

      <div class="meta">Market forces</div>
      <h2>Volatility and competition</h2>
      <p>
        Ingredient price swings driven by climate, geopolitics, and trade
        policies can pressure margins. While the luxury sector remains resilient,
        dips in local purchasing power may affect European sales, making Asian
        and Middle Eastern markets key growth pillars. Kōbō competes with
        renowned French maisons such as Pierre Hermé, La Maison du Chocolat, and
        Patrick Roger, as well as Japanese chocolatiers in Paris. Gourmet
        pastries and macarons represent indirect competition.

      <h2>Packaging and limited editions</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
          To honor exceptional products, Kōbō invests in premium, eco-conscious
          packaging from specialized partners. European anti-waste legislation
          accelerates the shift to sustainable materialsraising costs but
          strengthening the brand image. Limited editions accompany moments like
          Lunar New Year, Valentines Day, Easter, and holiday advent calendars.
          Custom finishes and personalization options reflect both Franco-Japanese
          aesthetics and client-specific needs.

      <div class="meta">Communications</div>
      <h2>Promotion and quality stewardship</h2>
      <p>
        Kōbōs promotion strategy leans on social media storytellingimmersive
        TikTok videos showcasing artisanal processes, ingredient provenance, and
        the interplay of Japanese and French aesthetics. In 2023, a batch of
        matcha displayed subtle taste and color variations. The brand responded
        by highlighting the authenticity of single-harvest matcha and investing
        in cryogenic preservation research to protect flavor integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced inventory systems balance limited seasonal runs with demand.
        Strict climate control protects cacao, matcha, and filled chocolates
        during storage and shipping, ensuring consistency across boutiques.

      <h2>Training, culture, and craftsmanship</h2>
      <div class="split">
        <p>
          Rapid international growth created staffing challenges; the brand will
          not compromise on skill or quality. Kōbōs leadership cultivates a
          participative, exacting, and caring management style rooted in respect
          for Franco-Japanese traditions. Continuous training preserves
          multi-generational know-how, while financial incentives, tailored
          career paths, and mobility opportunities foster loyalty.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/gallery-atelier.jpg" alt="Artisan training" />

      <p>
        Employee wellbeing is central: calming work environments, cultural
        sharing moments, and creative freedom in bespoke projects. The main risk
        remains the loss of artisanal expertise and the pressure of sustaining
        the brands image during rapid expansion. Intercultural training and
        weekly exchanges help align teams across markets.
